[DEBUG][ImproveService] LLM Prompt:
You are a senior recruiter reviewing this resume. Rewrite it to better match the job description while preserving facts and truthfulness. You must not change more than 35% of the actual content. Only make substantive changes, not formatting, whitespace, or minor edits. If unsure, change less.

Guidelines:
1. Output the entire resume using markdown only.
   - Use # for the main name/title, ## for section headings (e.g. ## Skills), and ### for job titles.
   - Use **bold** for section titles and important keywords.
   - Use * for bullet points.
   - Keep all spacing and order as in the original.
2. Do not output any text outside the markdown-formatted resume.
3. In the Skills & Abilities section, add or replace at least 2 missing skills/abilities from the job post.
4. In Experience, add or rewrite bullet points to match the job's main functions.
5. Maintain the same structure (name, experience, education, skills, etc.). Structure is extremely important: the resume must remain a single-page document, with clear sections and logical flow.
6. 7. Limit the tailored resume to one page maximum (about 500 words or 5-7 sections/paragraphs).
8. If the original resume is shorter, do not exceed its length.
9. Use UK English spelling, grammar, and conventions throughout.
10. Preserve all formatting: use headings for sections, bullet points for lists, bold for section titles, and keep spacing as in the original.
11. Example markdown output:
